======
##  introduction
let me  介绍一下我们的工程目录  
   1 calssify : is  classify code  
   2 Vector  :  is entityVector and relationVector by TransE embedding  
   3 FB15k  :   my  dataset      
   4 Cvector  : I don't know  
   
## 2 how to use
1  Just Train tranE.py and to product entityVector.csv and relationVector.csv  

2   Train transE.py and test test.py.  
3    run my  Classify/ClassifyVector.py  to use K-means to classify 10  
  
If shut down during training, also can run reTrans.py to continue.   
  
Finally, also can use pca.py to dimensionality reduction, and plot in .png
